This is my dwmstatus "script", which I run on Arch Linux.

Compilation
    * Just run `make`.
    You can also use some flags:
        * NO_PULSE=1    => Turns off pulseaudio (volume) support
        * NO_MPD=1      => Turns off MPD (current song) support
        * NO_WIRELESS=1 => Turns off wireless support
        Add them like so:
        `make NO_PULSE=1 NO_WIRELESS=1 all`

Some credits:
    * An old version of ponymix (https://github.com/falconindy/ponymix), upon which the pulseaudio code is (partially) based.
    * The guys at suckless.org. The early versions of this were based on their (example) dwmstatus, although the resemblance is small now.
