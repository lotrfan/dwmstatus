This is my dwmstatus "script", which I run on Arch Linux.

Some credits:
    * An old version of ponymix (https://github.com/falconindy/ponymix), upon which the pulseaudio code is (partially) based.
    * The guys at suckless.org. The early versions of this were based on their (example) dwmstatus, although the resemblance is small now.
